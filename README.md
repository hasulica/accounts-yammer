# Yammer Accounts support for Meteor

This is an early draft release - functional, but only just. Don't rely on it for anything mission-critical or sensitive!

## Usage

### Registering an app with Yammer

See documentation here: https://developer.yammer.com/introduction/#gs-registerapp

### Configuration

Using config details generated by Yammer, add the following to, for example a `config.js` file in your Meteor project:

    ServiceConfiguration.configurations.remove({
        service: "yammer"
    });

    ServiceConfiguration.configurations.insert({
        service: "yammer",
        clientId:  "",
        secret: "",
        loginStyle: "popup"         // "redirect" is the other option
    });

### Logging in

On the client, call the `Meteor.loginWithYammer()` function. See the Meteor
documentation (https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/meteor_loginwithexternalservice) for details of the
parameters.

Note that at this time Yammer does not support any `requestPermissions` values.
